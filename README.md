# Sleep Tracker App

Welcome to the repository for my Sleep Tracker App, a mobile application designed to help users monitor and understand their sleep patterns for improved well-being.

## About The Project

This Sleep Tracker App is built using React Native and Expo, which enables a seamless experience across both Android and iOS devices. The app features an intuitive interface with a night-time theme, allowing users to log their sleep, view detailed insights, and gain a better understanding of their sleep habits.
